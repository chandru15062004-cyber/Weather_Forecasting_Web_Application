# Weather_Forecasting_Web_Application
Developed a Weather Forecasting Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to search by city and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with dynamic UI updates and basic error handling.
